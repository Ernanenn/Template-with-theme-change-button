# Light to Dark Mode Switching

## Description
This project implements a simple theme switching system (light/dark) for websites. The user can click a button to switch between the light theme and the dark theme.

## Features
Theme switching: The user can switch between the light theme and the dark theme.
Dynamic text and colors: The text and background colors change according to the selected theme.
Button adaptation: The text and background color of the button automatically adapt to better contrast with the selected theme.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Page structure.
CSS: Page styling and definition of global color variables.
JavaScript: CSS class manipulation to switch themes and update the button text.

## How to Use
Clone the repository: git clone https://[your_repository]
Open the index.html file: Open the index.html file in your browser.
Click the "Dark" button: The site theme will switch to dark mode. Click it again to switch back to light mode.

## File Structure
index.html: Main page file.
styles.css: CSS style file.
app.js: JavaScript file with theme switching logic.

## Future Improvements
Theme persistence: Store user preference (light or dark theme) in cookies or localStorage so that the setting is persisted between sessions.
More themes: Add support for more color themes, such as color-based themes or gradient themes.
Theme transitions: Implement smooth transitions between themes for a better visual experience.

## Notes
Accessibility: It is important to ensure that the contrast between the text and the background is sufficient in both themes to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.
Customization: You can easily customize the theme colors by editing the CSS variables defined in :root.
Code extension: This example is basic, but can be expanded to include additional styles for different elements of the page.
